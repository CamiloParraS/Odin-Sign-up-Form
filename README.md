# Sign-up Form Project

This project is part of The Odin Project's Intermediate HTML and CSS Course. It focuses on creating a sign-up form for an imaginary service called "DeepSpace," incorporating a visually appealing design with a background image, custom fonts, and form validation styling.
## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a sign-up form that demonstrates proficiency in HTML and CSS, including the use of CSS custom properties, pseudo-classes, flexbox, and form styling. The form is divided into two main sections: a left sidebar with a background image and a right section containing the sign-up form.
